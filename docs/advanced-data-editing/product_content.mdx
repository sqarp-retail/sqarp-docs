### Images

Each row represents one image.

To add several images to the same product, you create several rows with the same manufacturer article number.

The order of the images matter and will have the same order in the SQARP platform as they have in the sheet.

To add a new image, simply add a new row, identify the product you want to add the image to using the manufacturer article number. Finally, add the URL.

To remove an image from a product that currently has several images, remove the whole row for that image. To remove an image from a product that has one image, remove only the image URL.
