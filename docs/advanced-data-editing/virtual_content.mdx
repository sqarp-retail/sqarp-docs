### Images

Each row represents one image.

The URL must be a path to an image file. Each virtual can have none, one or several images.

To add several images to the same virtual, you create several rows with the same internal reference.

The order of the images matter and will have the same order in the SQARP platform as they have in the sheet.

To add a new image, simply add a new row, identify the virtual you want to add the image to using the internal reference. Finally, add the URL.
:::danger
To remove an image from a virtual that currently has several images, remove the whole row for that image. To remove an image from a virtual that has one image, remove only the image URL.
:::
:::tip
To change the order of images, change the order of the rows, so that the image you want as primary appears first and so on.
:::
Only the virtuals included in the template will be affected by the change upon upload.

### Documents

Each row represents one document.

The URL must be a path to a document file. Each virtual can have none, one or several documents.

To add several documents to the same virtual, you create several rows with the same internal reference.

To add a new document, simply add a new row, identify the virtual you want to add the document to using the internal reference. Finally, add the URL, document type and language.
:::danger
To remove a document from a virtual that currently has several documents, remove the whole row for that document. To remove a document from a virtual that has one document, remove only the document URL, document type and language.
:::
Only the virtuals included in the template will be affected by the change upon upload.

### Videos

Each row represents one video.

The URL must be a path to an externally hosted video. Each virtual can have none, one or several videos.

To add several videos to the same virtual, you create several rows with the same internal reference.

To add a new video, simply add a new row, identify the virtual you want to add the video to using the internal reference. Finally, add the URL, video type and language.
:::danger
To remove a video from a virtual that currently has several videos, remove the whole row for that video. To remove a video from a product that has one video, remove only the video URL, video type and language.
:::
Only the virtuals included in the template will be affected by the change upon upload.


### Descriptions

Each row represents one description block.

Each description block can consist of a header, description, bullets, image and video.

Each description block must be filled in either description or bullets - but can of course have data in all columns.

Each virtual can have none, one or several description blocks.

To add several description blocks to the same virtual, you create several rows with the same internal reference.



To add a new description block, simply add a new row, identify the virtual you want to add the description block to using the internal reference. Then add the contents to the description block.
:::danger
To remove a description block from a virtual that currently has several description blocks, remove the whole row for that block.

To remove a description block from a virtual that has one description block, remove all data except the internal reference.
:::
Remember that the order of description blocks matter and will have the same order in the SQARP platform as in this sheet.
:::tip
To change the order of description blocks, change the order of the rows, so that the block you want as primary appears first, and so on.
:::
Only the virtuals included in the template will be affected by the change upon upload.
