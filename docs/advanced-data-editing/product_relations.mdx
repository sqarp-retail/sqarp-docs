# Product relations

### Module overview

In this module, we manage product relations in SQARP. Product relations is a collective word for the four relation types available in SQARP: Accessories, Spare parts, Components and Addons. Associated with addons are Addon Categories which are also covered in this module.

The relation templates are not language dependent. The addon category template is language dependent.

:::caution SQARP GOLD STANDARD

- Build relations in one direction, from the main product to the related product. It’s generally not a good idea to also build it the other way around.
- Include an appropriate description of addon categories to guide the customer through the selection of addons.
- Build addon categories functionally, not just using product types
- It’s great to add some generic accessories that are appropriate to recommend along with the main product. Don’t include to many though, five is a good benchmark for these kinds of generic accessories.

## How to use the editing template


### Product relations templates

#### Accessories and spare parts

Accessories and spare parts are two different sheets independent of one another that have the same structure.

Each row represents one relation.

A product can have none, one or several relations.

To add a new relation, add a new row and fill the relevant article numbers for the main product and the related product.

To remove a relation from a product that has multiple relations, remove the whole row representing that relation.

To remove a relation from a product that has one relation, remove only the related manufacturer article number.

Only the products included in the template will be affected by the change upon upload.

#### Components

Each row represents one relation.

A product can have none, one or several relations.

To add a new relation, add a new row and fill the relevant article numbers for the main product, the related product and the quantity.

To remove a relation from a product that has multiple relations, remove the whole row representing that relation.

To remove a relation from a product that has one relation, remove the related manufacturer article number and the quantity.

Only the products included in the template will be affected by the change upon upload.

#### Addons

### Addon category templates

#### Addon categories

Each row represents one addon category.

Reference to a brand and addon category slugs are mandatory.

You can add addon category translations in multiple languages by inserting new columns and setting the header to addoncategory_translation_XX where XX is the language code of the language you wish to include.

To add a new addon category, create a new row in the template and fill with appropriate data.

To change or remove information on an addon category, change or remove the information in the appropriate cells.

Only the addon categories included in the template will be affected by the change upon upload.

#### Images

Each row represents one image.

The URL must be a path to an image file. Each addon category can have none, one or several images.

To add several images to the same addon category, you create several rows with the same addon category slug and brand reference.

The order of the images matter and will have the same order in the SQARP platform as they have in the sheet.

To add a new image, simply add a new row, identify the addon category you want to add the image to using the slug for the addon category and the reference to the brand. Finally, add the URL.

To remove an image from an addon category that currently has several images, remove the whole row for that image. To remove an image from an addon category that has one image, remove only the image URL.

To change the order of images, change the order of the rows, so that the image you want as primary appears first and so on.

Only the addon categories included in the template will be affected by the change upon upload.

#### Documents

Each row represents one document.

The URL must be a path to a document file. Each addon category can have none, one or several documents.

To add several documents to the same addon category, you create several rows with the same addon category slug and brand reference.

To add a new document, simply add a new row, identify the addon category you want to add the document to using the slug for the addon category and the reference to the brand. Finally, add the URL, document type and language.

To remove a document from an addon category that currently has several documents, remove the whole row for that document. To remove a document from an addon category that has one document, remove only the document URL, document type and language.

Only the addon categories included in the template will be affected by the change upon upload.

#### Videos

Each row represents one video.

The URL must be a path to an externally hosted video. Each addon category can have none, one or several videos.

To add several videos to the same addon category, you create several rows with the same addon category slug and brand reference.

To add a new video, simply add a new row, identify the addon category you want to add the video to using the slug for the addon category and the reference to the brand. Finally, add the URL, video type and language.

To remove a video from a addon category that currently has several videos, remove the whole row for that video. To remove a video from an addon category that has one video, remove only the video URL, video type and language.

#### Descriptions

Each row represents one description block.

Each description block can consist of a header, description, bullets, image and video.

Each description block must be filled in either description or bullets - but can of course have data in all columns.

Each addon category can have none, one or several description blocks.

To add several description blocks to the same addon category, you create several rows with the same addon category slug.

Remember that the order of description blocks matter and will have the same order in the SQARP platform as in this sheet.

To add a new description block, simply add a new row, identify the addon category you want to add the description block to using the slug for the addon category and the reference to the brand. Then add the contents to the description block.

To remove a description block from an addon category that currently has several description blocks, remove the whole row for that block.

To remove a description block from an addon category that has one description block, remove all data except the brand reference and the addon category slug.

To change the order of description blocks, change the order of the rows, so that the block you want as primary appears first, and so on.

Only the addon categories included in the template will be affected by the change upon upload.
