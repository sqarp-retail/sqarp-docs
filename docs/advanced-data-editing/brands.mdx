### Brands

Each row represents one brand entity.


Brands have one global name. If your brand has different names in different languages, please create multiple brands.

To add a new brand, create a new row in the template, identify the brand entity using a slug for the brand, add the brand_name and the URL for the brand logo. Finally the URL for the brand_page if applicable.

To change or remove information for a brand, change or remove the information in the appropriate cells.

Only the brands included in the template will be affected by the change upon upload.

### Images

Each row represents one image.

The URL must be a path to an image file. Each brand can have none, one or several images.

To add several images to the same brand, you create several rows with the same brand\_name\_slug.



To add a new image, simply add a new row, identify the brand entity you want to add the image to using the slug for the brand and add the image URL.
:::danger
To remove an image from a brand that currently has several images, remove the whole row for that image. To remove an image from a brand that has one image, remove only the image URL.
:::
The order of the images matter and will have the same order in the SQARP platform as they have in the sheet.
:::tip
To change the order of images, change the order of the rows, so that the image you want as primary appears first and so on.
:::
Only the brands included in the template will be affected by the change upon upload.

### Documents

Each row represents one document.

The URL must be a path to a document file. Each brand can have none, one or several documents.

To add several documents to the same brand, you create several rows with the same brand\_name\_slug.

To add a new document, simply add a new row, identify the brand entity you want to add the document to using the slug for the brand. Add a URL to the document file and then add meta information: identify the document type and the language of the document.
:::danger
To remove a document from a brand that currently has several documents, remove the whole row for that document. To remove a document from a brand that has one document, remove only the document URL, document type and language.
:::
Only the brands included in the template will be affected by the change upon upload.

### Videos

The URL must be a path to an externally hosted video. Each brand can have none, one or several videos.

### Descriptions

Each row represents one description block.

Each description block can consist of a header, description, bullets, image and video.

Each description block must be filled in either description or bullets - but can of course have data in all columns.

Each brand can have none, one or several description blocks.

To add several description blocks to the same brand, you create several rows with the same brand slug.

Remember that the order of description blocks matter and will have the same order in the SQARP platform as in this sheet.

To add a new description block, simply add a new row, identify the brand entity you want to add the description block to using the slug for the brand, the brand type and the reference to the brand. Then add the contents to the description block.
:::danger
To remove a description block from a brand that currently has several description blocks, remove the whole row for that block.

To remove a description block from a brand that has one description block, remove all data except the brand reference, the brand type and the brand slug.
