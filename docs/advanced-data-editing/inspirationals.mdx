Reference to a brand, inspirational type and inspirational slugs are mandatory.

You can add inspirational translations in multiple languages by inserting new columns and setting the header to inspirational\_translation\_XX where XX is the language code of the language you wish to include.

To add a new inspirational, create a new row in the template and fill with appropriate data.

Only the inspirationals included in the template will be affected by the change upon upload.

### Images

Each row represents one image.

The URL must be a path to an image file. Each inspirational can have none, one or several images.

To add several images to the same inspirational, you create several rows with the same inspirational slug, brand reference and inspirational type.
