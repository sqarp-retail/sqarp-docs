# What Is This Template?

This template is part of the **SQARP E-Optimization** process—a structured method for gathering high-quality, standardized product information from suppliers like you.

You will find sections covering:

- **Product identity** (e.g. internal & manufacturer article numbers, EAN-codes)
- **Logistics data** (e.g. packaging dimensions/weights, country of origin, taric codes)
- **Media** (images, documents, videos)
- **Descriptive content** (product descriptions, attributes/specifications)
- **Variant management** (for organizing and grouping together similar products)
- **Product relationships** (accessories and spare parts)
- **Brand and inspirational material** (images, descriptions, documents, videos related to a specific brand, series or USP)

Filling out this template ensures that your product data meets the standards needed to deliver those results.

### 2. Improve Discoverability and Compliance
Accurate, complete, and standardized data ensures:

- Your products appear in search results more often
- Customers understand what they’re buying
- You meet the growing demands for regulatory compliance (e.g. customs, sustainability)

## Why You Should Fill In as Many Fields as Possible

Incomplete product data limits visibility and conversion. Every field in the template contributes to:

- **Product discovery:** Titles, tags, categories, and attributes help users and algorithms find your product.
- **Purchase decisions:** Descriptions, specifications, images, and videos reassure buyers and highlight value.
- **Logistics:** Accurate size, weight, origin, and tariff info helps streamline logistical flows and supports legal requirements.

Each column in the template either feeds:

- An internal retailer system (for inventory, order handling)
- A front-end product page (for customer engagement)

> Leaving a field blank means missing an opportunity to optimize the performance and sales of your products online.
