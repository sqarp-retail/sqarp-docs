# Overview

In this module, we manage **product relations** in SQARP.  
Product relations is a collective term for the two relation types available in the **Basic Template**:  
- **Accessories**  
- **Spare parts**

---

## Context of the Entire Process

This module is where **compatibility relationships** are created between different products.  
These relationships are for accessories and spare parts — items purchased alongside another product.  

> This module **does not** handle related or alternative product suggestions such as *"You may also be interested in this"* or *"See also this product"*.

**Main objectives:**
- Create all relevant relationships and import them into SQARP so related items are displayed alongside other items.
- Help customers understand how the assortment is connected.
- Provide guidance for a smooth purchase experience.
- Ensure no important relationships are missed.
- Support order and logistics flows effectively.

## What Data Is Included in This Module?

A product relation is a **link** between:
- A **main product**
- A **related product**

**Important:** Both products must already exist in SQARP from earlier modules, or be present in the SQARP data template you are currently working on.

## Why Is This Module Important?

### 1. Helps Customers Understand the Assortment Structure
- Especially valuable for **complex** or **technical** product ranges where multiple item numbers are needed for a complete product.
- Guides the customer through the purchase journey.

### 2. Increases the Likelihood of a Satisfied Customer
- Displays relevant relationships with the main product to reduce the risk of missing important add-ons.
- Inspires customers to complete their purchase.
- Ensures customers get the **full experience** of the product.

### 3. Boost Average Order Value
- Relevant compatibility relationships can convert **up to 50%** on main product purchases.
- Improves profitability by spreading shipping costs across more items.
- The digital equivalent of an **in-store display**.

**Examples:**
- Fried onions with hot dog buns.
- Mounting bracket with TVs.

### 4. Minimize Clicks Needed to Build a Complete Cart
- Without defined relationships, customers must manually navigate categories or search — often **8–12 extra clicks**.
- This reduces purchase likelihood and increases uncertainty about compatibility.

## Tips & Tricks / Best Practice

:::caution SQARP GOLD STANDARD
- Build relationships **in one direction** — from the main product to the related product.
- Avoid building relationships in both directions.
- Include a few **generic accessories** that make sense, but don’t overload — **five is a good rule of thumb**.
