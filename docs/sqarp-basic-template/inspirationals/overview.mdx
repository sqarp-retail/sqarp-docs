# Overview

In this module, inspirational entities and their relations to products are managed.  
**Inspirational entities** is the collective term for **Brands**, **Series**, and **USPs** in SQARP.  
This module is **language-dependent**.

Each product **must** be connected to a **Brand** and can optionally carry one or more **Series** and/or **USP entities**.

You can create and enrich your inspirationals in the **SQARP Basic Template**:  
- See sheets `basic_brands_xx` for Brands  
- See sheets `basic_inspirationals_xx` for Series and USPs

---

## Context in the Entire Process

This section manages information not tied to specific products but still highly relevant for consumers to understand a product range. Inspirational entities allow information to be stored at the **correct level of abstraction** with a **single source of truth**.

If data for inspirationals were stored on each product, any change would require updating hundreds of products. By storing data on entities and linking them to products, you avoid duplication and simplify management.

Examples of inspirational entities:
- Brand
- Series / Collection
- USP / Technology / Material
- Category (broad product groups)

**Goal:** Consolidate all marketing information relevant to a customer’s buying journey and/or navigation of a product range.  
All data should be standardized and include explicit relationships between inspirational entities and products.

> **SEO note:** Inspirational content can help drive organic traffic to landing pages. Perform keyword analysis to ensure chosen entities reflect actual customer search demand.

## What Data Is Included in This Module?

Three groups of inspirational entities exist in the Basic Template. You can create any number of entities within each group:

### Brand
- Highest-level inspirational entity in SQARP’s hierarchy.
- Encapsulates the entire brand without focusing on specific products.
- Used to create brand pages on e-commerce sites.
- Critical for attracting organic traffic from brand-related search queries.

### Series
- Sub-collections of a brand’s assortment.
- Defined by the manufacturer (functional, design, or price categories).
- Products can belong to multiple series, and a series can include multiple categories.

### USP (Unique Selling Points)
- Sub-collections defined by technology, function, design, material, etc.
- Each USP is linked to a brand.
- Products can have multiple USPs.
- Broadest definition; any inspirational content not tied to a brand or series can be a USP.

**Entity structure:**
- Name
- Brand link
- Images
- Documents
- Videos
- Descriptions

**Rules:**
- Products are linked to entities via relationships.
- Each entity is linked to a brand.
