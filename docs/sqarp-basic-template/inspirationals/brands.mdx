## Adding More Content Blocks

To add more content blocks to your brand, create **new columns** in the template.  
In the example below, the yellow-marked columns have been created for additional description blocks.

**Important:** When duplicating description content, **all three columns** must be added together:
- `description_header_[number]`
- `description_[number]`
- `description_bullets_[number]`

The same rule applies to **documents** and **videos** (i.e., duplicate the full set of related columns with the incremented `[number]`).
