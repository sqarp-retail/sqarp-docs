### Descriptions Linked to Products and Main Articles
- In SQARP, descriptions are composed of **description blocks**.

  - Bullet points
- Multiple description blocks can be assigned to the same product.
- The **order** of description blocks determines the display order in the SQARP platform.

- This is a **flexible data structure** for storing attribute information:
  - Headings
  - Keys
  - Values
- No predefined fields are needed — this structure can effectively represent all relevant technical specifications.
