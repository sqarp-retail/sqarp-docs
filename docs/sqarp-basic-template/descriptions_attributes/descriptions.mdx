# Descriptions

Each **description block** consists of:
- A **header**
- A **description**
- **Bullets**

Each block must have content in **either** the description or bullets column â€” but can also have data in **all** columns.

A product can have:
- No description blocks
- One description block
- Several description blocks

---

## Adding Multiple Description Blocks

To add several description blocks for the same product:
1. Create **additional columns** in the data template.
2. Remember: the **order** of description blocks in the template is the same as in the SQARP platform.
3. For each new block, create **three columns**:
   - `description_header_[number]`
   - `description_[number]`
   - `description_bullets_[number]`
4. Identify the product using its article number.
5. Fill in the header, description, and/or bullets for that block.
